          Hello! I’m Rohit, a passionate Frontend Developer with expertise in building dynamic and user-friendly web applications.

          Coding is more than just a job for me; it’s a passion for solving problems and building impactful solutions. I’m always eager to grow and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. Right now, I’m exploring Node.js to expand my skills and transition toward becoming a Full-Stack Developer.

          When I’m not coding, I enjoy cricket—whether watching exciting matches or playing with friends, it helps me relax and maintain a healthy work-life balance. I believe that a good balance between work and personal interests keeps me motivated and creative.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I’m excited to collaborate on new projects, tackle challenges, and deliver high-quality, user-centered web experiences.
